An online code and markdown playground where you can write react or pure web code and write docs for the same. Install any npm pacakage by just writting the import statement. The code transpiles and bundles in the browser making the code execution rediculusoly fast. The code-compilation logic in the browser is taken from Stephen Grinder's course project, Is built with React, Express, Mongoose, Typescript, TailwindCSS and Esbuild to compile the code and monaco editor to bring the editor to the web.
